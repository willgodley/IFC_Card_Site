# IFC_Card_Site

I want to create a user-based website that makes guest lists for IFC events at umich. I have already created a python program to do this, but the program has two large issues. People often forget to upload event data and searching past guest lists is clunky. Both of these problems would be solved in this redo. The design of the site would be simple and similar to a Google Form. It would look nice, but data entry would be simple and most of the time would only require the swipe of an Mcard once an event is created. 

Each house would receive one account that could create an event and swipe students in and out of that event. IFC executive members would be given accounts that could go through past records as well as edit them. Final records of events contain the following data for each student: First initial (this is because of the data you get from swiping an Mcard), last name, UM student (Y/N), UMID (if applicable), time in, time out.
